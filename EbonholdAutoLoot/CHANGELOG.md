# Changelog — EbonholdAutoLoot

## [2.8] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- README fully rewritten to reflect all features from v2.2 onward: on-screen vendor button, mount-aware companion management, item whitelist (renamed from blacklist), Tome of Echo one-click whitelisting, updated GUI diagram, and corrected selling-in-combat instructions.
- Fixed arrow glyph (`→`) in vendor hint text — replaced with a plain comma as the character is unsupported in WoW 3.3.5a's font.

---

## [2.7] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Renamed all player-facing "blacklist" text to "whitelist": GUI section header now reads `ITEM WHITELIST`, sell summary message now says "Whitelisted (kept):", and the `/eal reset` confirmation prints "Whitelist cleared." Internal variable and function names unchanged.

---

## [2.6] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **"Whitelist all Tome of Echo: in bags"** button in the blacklist panel. Scans all bag slots and adds every item whose name begins with `Tome of Echo:` to the blacklist (skipping duplicates). Prints how many were added. Uses a prefix-match (`string.sub` against `"tome of echo:"`) so no regex escaping is needed.

---

## [2.5] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- `SellItems()` now sells in batches of up to 80 items while the vendor window stays open. After each full batch it waits **0.5 seconds** then automatically sells the next batch, repeating until all qualifying items are gone. Totals are accumulated across batches and a single summary line is printed at the end. This prevents a flood of `UseContainerItem` calls in one frame tick that could disconnect low-end clients, without requiring the player to reopen the vendor.

## [2.4] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- `SellItems()` now caps at **80 `UseContainerItem` calls per pulse** via `MAX_SELL_PER_PULSE = 80`. Once the cap is hit the inner and outer bag loops break immediately, preventing a flood of sell packets in a single `MERCHANT_SHOW` callback that could disconnect low-end clients. A chat notice is printed when the cap is reached, reminding the player to reopen the vendor to sell the remaining items.

---

## [2.3] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Mount-aware companion management**: `OnUpdate` now tracks `IsPlayerMountedOrFlying()` across frames. On mount → dismisses whichever companion is currently out. On dismount → re-summons the correct companion after a 1.5s delay (engine requires a brief pause before `CallCompanion` is accepted after dismounting): Greedy Scavenger if in `S_LOOTING`, Goblin Merchant if in `S_SELLING`. No re-summon occurs if the addon is disabled or in `S_IDLE`.
- Bag check and stuck detection are skipped while mounted to avoid interfering with the dismount re-summon flow.

---

## [2.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **On-screen vendor button** (`EAL_VendorBtn`): a 60×60 `SecureActionButtonTemplate` button parented directly to `UIParent`. Its `type=macro` / `macrotext=/target Goblin Merchant` attribute is set once at creation (outside combat) so it fires correctly even during combat lockdown — no `PreClick` toggling, no `SetAttribute` calls in combat. Features a coin icon, gold border overlay, "Vendor" label, tooltip, and **Alt+Drag** to reposition with position saved to `SavedVariables`.
- **Show/Hide Vendor Btn** toggle in the GUI replaces the old "Bind F5" button. State persisted via `vendorBtnShown` in `SavedVariables`.

### Removed
- Macro + keybind approach (`VendorBind` macro, `SetBinding("F5", ...)`, `SaveBindings`). Replaced entirely by the on-screen secure button.

---

## [2.1] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Vendor macro reworked to match the `VendorBind` pattern. Creates a **per-character** macro (`VendorBind`) with `/target Goblin Merchant` and immediately binds **F5** to it via `SetBinding` + `SaveBindings(2)`. The previous approach used a global macro slot and left keybinding to the player; this version wires the key automatically. F5 targets the NPC — the player then presses their separate **Interact with Target** key to open the vendor.
- GUI button relabelled from "Create Macro" to "Bind F5" to reflect the actual action.

### Fixed
- Previous v2.0 code called two `SetBinding` calls on the same key (macro + INTERACTTARGET), with the second silently overwriting the first. Corrected to a single `SetBinding` for the targeting macro only.

---

## [2.0] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Vendor macro** (`EAL Merchant`): automatically created in your general Macro book every time you log in. The macro runs `/targetexact Goblin Merchant`, letting you target the vendor companion during combat. Once targeted, use your **Interact with Target** keybind or right-click the NPC to open the vendor window and trigger the auto-sell. A **"Create Macro"** button in the GUI lets you recreate or refresh it at any time while out of combat.

### Changed
- Window height expanded to 496px to accommodate the new vendor macro row between the Enable/Force Sell buttons and the quality toggles.

---

## [1.9] - 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Blacklist scroll UI simplified: removed Up/Down button controls. Scrolling is now mouse-wheel only. A slim 8px scrollbar track with a proportional amber thumb on the right edge of the list gives a clean visual position indicator — it moves as you scroll but is not clickable. The thumb hides when all items fit without scrolling.

---

## [1.8] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Blacklist items now display correctly and Remove buttons now work. Root cause: `FauxScrollFrameTemplate` was still broken despite the v1.7 attempt — even with rows parented directly to the scroll frame, the template's internal scroll child movement conflicted with manual row positioning. Replaced entirely with a hand-rolled list: rows are parented directly to `listBg` at fixed offsets, a `g_blacklistOffset` integer tracks the scroll position, and Up/Down buttons plus mouse wheel (`OnMouseWheel`) update the offset and call `EAL_RefreshBlacklist`. No WoW scroll API is used at all.

---

## [1.7] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- Blacklist items now appear in the scroll panel after being added. Root cause: rows were parented to a `listContainer` frame that was set as the `ScrollFrame`'s scroll child. `FauxScrollFrameTemplate` manages row visibility manually via a logical offset and is not designed to work with a scroll child — the ScrollFrame widget was physically moving `listContainer` (and its children) on every scroll event, fighting the FauxScrollFrame offset logic and preventing rows from rendering in the correct positions. Fixed by removing `listContainer` and `SetScrollChild` entirely; rows are now parented directly to the scroll frame, which is the standard FauxScrollFrame pattern.
- Added `scrollFrame.offset = 0` initialisation and `or 0` fallback in `EAL_RefreshBlacklist` so `FauxScrollFrame_GetOffset` never returns nil on first paint.

---

## [1.6] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Auto-repair on merchant open: calls `RepairAllItems()` before selling whenever `CanMerchantRepair()` returns true. Repair runs first so durability is restored regardless of whether the sell step finds anything. Prints "All items repaired." to chat when triggered.

---

## [1.5] - 2026-04-06

### Removed
- `CreateVendorMacro()`, `VENDOR_MACRO_NAME`, `VENDOR_MACRO_BODY` constants, the "Create Macro" GUI button, and the `/eal macro` slash command. `CreateMacro` and `InteractUnit` both require hardware events or non-combat context and could not be made to work reliably.
- "IN-COMBAT VENDOR" GUI section removed entirely.

### Changed
- Window height reduced to 460 px; quality toggles and blacklist shifted up to fill the space.
- Header comment updated to document the hard limitation: `InteractUnit` is Blizzard-UI-only with no client-side workaround. The fully automatic selling path requires the server to fire `MERCHANT_SHOW` automatically when the Goblin Merchant companion is summoned.

---

## [1.4] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `/eal` and the window close button now work during combat. The `InCombatLockdown()` guards added in v1.3 were overly conservative — they are only required when a frame contains `SecureActionButtonTemplate` children, which was removed in v1.3. Plain frames with regular buttons and checkboxes can be shown and hidden freely at any time.

---

## [1.3] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- `/eal` no longer triggers "Interface action failed because of an AddOn". Root cause: `SecureActionButtonTemplate` cannot be parented to a regular addon-controlled frame — the engine blocks `Show`/`Hide` on any frame that has secure children.

### Changed
- Removed the `SecureActionButtonTemplate` "Target Vendor" button from the GUI entirely. The action-bar macro (`/eal macro`) is the correct and fully supported in-combat approach.
- Replaced the two-button vendor row with a single "Create Macro" button and an instruction hint label.
- Added `InCombatLockdown()` guard to the `/eal` slash command and the window close button so the GUI is never shown or hidden during combat lockdown.
- Removed `pulseTimer`, `g_interactBtn`, and `g_interactBtnGlow` runtime variables.
- Window height reduced back to 510 px.

---

## [1.2] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- Companion stuck detection: every bag-check tick, if the Greedy Scavenger is more than 5 yards from the player it is dismissed and re-summoned automatically.
- `IsPlayerMountedOrFlying()` — stuck detection is suppressed while the player is on a mount or airborne so the pet is not needlessly bounced during travel.
- `GetCompanionDistance()` — uses `UnitPosition("player")` and `UnitPosition("pet")` for a 2-D yard distance; returns `nil` gracefully if position data is unavailable.

### Changed
- Stuck check shares the existing `bagCheckTimer` interval (default 3 s) with no additional `OnUpdate` overhead.
- Stuck check is skipped on the same tick that triggers a sell cycle to prevent a dismiss colliding with the sell-cycle dismiss.

---

## [1.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- `SecureActionButtonTemplate` "Target Vendor" button in the GUI — targets the Goblin Merchant as a hardware event, works during combat lockdown.
- `EBVendor` macro generator (`/eal macro` or "Create Macro" button) — writes a `/targetexact Goblin Merchant` macro to the player's macro book, ready to drag to an action bar for in-combat use.
- Button pulse animation while state is SELLING to prompt the player to interact.
- Tooltips on both the Target Vendor and Create Macro buttons explaining the correct in-combat vendor flow.

### Changed
- Removed `/script InteractUnit('target')` from macro body — `InteractUnit` is Blizzard-UI-only and blocked in all macro/addon contexts regardless of hardware event status.
- In-combat vendor flow updated: addon targets the NPC; player opens vendor via right-click or Interact with Target keybind.
- Status bar and chat messages updated to reflect the correct two-step combat interaction.
- Window height increased to 552px to accommodate the new vendor button row.

### Removed
- `S_QUEUED` state and `sellQueued` flag.
- `PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED` / `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED` event listeners and combat-queue logic.

---

## [1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Auto-loot cycle using the Greedy Scavenger companion pet.
- Bag-full detection (polls every 3 seconds via `OnUpdate`).
- Auto-switch to Goblin Merchant companion when bags are full.
- Auto-sell on `MERCHANT_SHOW` — sells all qualifying items the moment any vendor window opens.
- Per-quality sell toggles: Grey (default on), White, Uncommon, Rare, Epic.
- Item blacklist with scrollable list, add-by-name input, and per-entry Remove buttons.
- Case-insensitive companion name matching (`FindCompanion`).
- Live status display showing current state (IDLE / LOOTING / SELLING) and free bag slot count.
- Enable/Disable toggle and Force Sell Now button.
- Draggable, persistent window position saved via `SavedVariables`.
- Slash commands: `/eal`, `/autoloot`, `/eal enable`, `/eal disable`, `/eal reset`.
